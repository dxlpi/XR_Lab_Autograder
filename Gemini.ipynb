      "Justification: The document includes a title page, what appears to be a table of contents placeholder with instructions (though the TOC itself is missing), labeled sections for the architect's biography, buildings portfolio, references, and the student's bio. The absence of a real TOC, though, is a significant flaw.\n",

      "Justification: The biographical content covers many of the key areas: her early life and education, her partnership with Ryue Nishizawa to form SANAA, her architectural style and philosophy, major works and their significance, recognition and influence. It is well-written and comprehensive. The length appears appropriate, but the lack of a word count feature in this format makes it difficult to confirm the 750-word requirement.\n",

      "Justification: The biography includes in-text citations, and there's a dedicated \"References\" section. However, the citation style is inconsistent and doesn't conform to APA. Many citations are also missing DOIs. Some sources, like \"Pritzker Prize website,\" are acceptable but not ideal for a formal academic submission. The citation counts are missing. The number of references is acceptable.\n",

      "Justification: For each building, the student provides a good number of images, often exceeding the specified 3+ exterior and 5+ interior images. The image quality is generally acceptable, though some are slightly lower resolution than ideal. The selection of images is well-done.\n",
