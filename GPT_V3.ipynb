    "  - Accuracy of academic citations\n",
    "  - Caption and image attribution clarity\n",
    "  - Clear distinction between interior vs exterior images\n",
    "  - Overall layout and visual professionalism\n",

    "-  A student photo and bio appear on Page 2\n",

    "-  10 buildings are described\n",
    "-  Redundant links are likely citations, not missing content\n",
